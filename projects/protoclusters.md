# Interstellar Gas as a Diagnostic of Galaxy Clustering in the Early Universe

*2016 - 2018*

There's a reason we don't live in a galaxy cluster; in that tight-knit environment, hot intergalactic gas strips galaxies of the cool gas clouds that would otherwise collapse to form new stars. These *massive* structures weren't born over night, and we can look at their progressive formation as a probe of the structural evolution of the Universe as a whole. Using observations of distant galaxies, I studied two infant galaxy clusters (*~10 billion light years away*) to guage the level of gas depletion they exhibit—a key characteristic of mature galaxy clusters.

I pooled data from a number of different datasets and used a stacking technique to estimate gas masses and quantify the average level of gas depletion for thousands of galaxies residing inside and outside of the two clusters. What I found is that these two cluster preogenitors are indeed starting to become gas-depleted, but as explected they have a long way to go before they look like the nearby galaxy clusters of today.
