# Slaying Hydra: A Python Analysis Pipeline for the Hydra Spectrograph

*2017 - 2018*

Even though we've discovered *thousands* of confirmed exoplanets, there's still a surprising amount we don't know about how young solar systems form and evolve over time. I worked with a team tackling this problem head-on by identifying planetary systems across of range of ages. The larger, ongoing project (<a href="https://andrewwmann.com/research.html" target="_blank">ZEIT</a>) searches for discrepancies in star and planet properties with system age in order to shed light on how solar systems evolve in their early years.

I took on a technical role in the collaboration, leading the development of a data extraction and analysis pipeline. To get precise ages for stars, we collect hundreds of spectroscopic observations with the <a href="" target="_blank">Hydra spectrograph</a>. The pipeline I created drastically speeds up processing of this data from it's raw form into processed spectral data products.

I presented this at <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas231" target="_blank">AAS 231</a> in 2018, take a look <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-RZeRsGpwXLlqMqc-U7miK9JOZsq21z/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>!
