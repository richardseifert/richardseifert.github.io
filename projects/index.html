    <h3>Getting a Grip on Graduation with Machine Learning</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
        <em>Spring 2020</em><br>
        I trained Random Forest and Neural Net models on publically available Virginia 
        high school graduation data in order to identify factors influencing students' decision to
        leave school early. With a tuned neural network model, we identified three important factors
        that the model relied on heavily when predicting dropout rates.</p>

    <h3>Ionization and its Influence on Forming Solar Systems</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
       <em>2018 - 2020</em><br>
       I produced a grid of numerical models with Fortran and C, and created a Python tool for manipulating and visualizing 
       the output. Using the tool I made, I undertook a detailed data modeling effort
       to measure the influence ionization has on the evolution of a young solar system, IM Lup. </p>

    <h3>Slaying Hydra: A Python Analysis Pipeline for the Hydra Spectrograph</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
        <em>2017 - 2018</em><br>
        I created a data processing pipeline in Python which is used to extract spectroscopic
        data from the Hydra spectrograph. The pipeline substantially expedites data extraction and analysis,
        of hundreds of stars, which are being studied as part of a larger project to understand how solar systems form. </p>

    <h3>Interstellar Gas as a Diagnostic of Galaxy Clustering in the Early Universe</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
        <em>2016 - 2018</em><br>
        I combined data from a number of different sources and performed a statistical analysis
        to estimate gas depletion in two ancient, massive galaxy cluster progenitors. </p>

    <h3>Finding Simple Observables to Predict White Dwarf Internal Structure</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
        <em>2014 - 2015</em><br>
        I automated the production of a suite of numerical models simulating the time series
        brightness of pulsating white dwarf stars. Using the simulations I produced, I validated
        a method for characterizing white dwarf stars using limited observational data.</p>
